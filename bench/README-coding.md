# Coding Task Benchmark

## Overview

This benchmark measures **code correctness** by having models write Python functions to solve self-contained coding tasks, then grading them against hidden test cases that are external to the model.

## Honesty Rules

This benchmark differs from the judgment/extraction proxy benchmark in critical ways:

1. **Hidden Test Cases**: The grader defines objective test cases that are NOT shown in the task prompts. The model never sees these during task completion.

2. **External Grading**: Correctness is determined by isolated subprocess execution against concrete inputs/outputs, not by model judgment.

3. **Small N Caveat**: With only 8 tasks, this measures code-correctness narrowly. Results should not be extrapolated beyond small Python functions.

4. **Deterministic**: Unlike natural language tasks, code either runs correctly or it doesn't. There is no ambiguity in grading.

## Tasks

Each task is a small, self-contained Python function. Haiku is the target model for these tasks.

- **fizzbuzz**: Generate FizzBuzz sequence
- **is_palindrome**: Check if string is palindrome (case/space insensitive)
- **find_prime**: Check if integer is prime
- **reverse_string**: Reverse string without built-in methods
- **remove_duplicates**: Remove duplicates while preserving order
- **fibonacci_nth**: Get nth Fibonacci number
- **binary_search**: Implement binary search on sorted list
- **count_vowels**: Count vowels in a string

## Running the Benchmark

### 1. Generate Candidate Solutions

Run a model over `coding_tasks.jsonl` to generate solutions:

```bash
python -m bench.coding_grader <task_id> <solution_file>
```

The task prompt tells the model to write a Python function with a specific name (entrypoint). For example:

```
Task: fizzbuzz
Entrypoint: fizzbuzz
Model must write a function: def fizzbuzz(n): ...
```

Save the model's complete output to a file.

### 2. Grade the Solution

```bash
python -m bench.coding_grader fizzbuzz solution.py
```

Output:
```json
{
  "task_id": "fizzbuzz",
  "passed": 15,
  "total": 15,
  "results": [...],
  "success": true
}
```

### 3. Interpret Results

- `success: true` means the model's function passed all hidden test cases
- `passed: X / total: Y` shows how many of the hidden cases passed
- `results[]` lists per-case verdicts (input, expected output, actual output, whether it passed)

## Implementation Notes

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Each solution runs in an isolated subprocess with a 5-second timeout
- **Stdlib Only**: No external dependencies; uses only Python standard library
- **Windows-Safe**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **JSON Protocol**: Test results and outputs are JSON for easy parsing

## Limitations

- This measures only small, deterministic Python functions
- It does not measure design patterns, readability, or performance
- Results are specific to the 8 tasks defined; generalizing beyond this set is not recommended
- All tasks have relatively small N (6-8 hidden test cases per task)

## Adding New Tasks

To add a new coding task:

1. Add entry to `coding_tasks.jsonl`: `{id, prompt, entrypoint}`
2. Add hidden test cases to `HIDDEN_TEST_CASES` in `coding_grader.py`
3. Add test cases to `tests/test_coding_grader.py`

Keep tasks self-contained and completable by Haiku.
